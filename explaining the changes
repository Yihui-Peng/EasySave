Bug Fiexed by Path Test:
1. Fixed the prompt text of the /login route when login fails. The test code expects the words "username or password is incorrect" to be included in the returned page.
2. Make sure the words "Daily Budget" appear on the home page to pass the path test, I changed the title from "Today's Budget" to "Daily Budget"
3. Displays the error text passed by the back-end in newRecords.html. In the /newRecords route, ensure that status code 200 is returned with an error message when form validation fails, rather than direct redirection.
