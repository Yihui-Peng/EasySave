\section{Software Development Process}
This project followed a Waterfall development approach, where each phase was completed sequentially before moving on to the next stage. The process was structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1}: Requirements analysis and gathering, including defining the objectives and key features of the project. At this stage, we identified the project's core theme and structure.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2}: System design, where the software architecture, data flow, and user interface designs were established. The team developed initial design sketches for the primary user interface and conducted an exploration of the required data and system architecture.
    \item \textbf{Phase 3}: Implementation, involving the actual development of the application, coding the features, and integrating the datasets. Tasks related to the implementation of various functionalities were assigned to different team members, with each member responsible for creating an individual page. Additionally, we integrated the database sourced from Kaggle with the user database we generated for testing purposes.
    \item \textbf{Phase 4}: Integration and testing, where the software was thoroughly tested to ensure functionality and to fix any bugs identified.
    \item \textbf{Phase 5}: Deployment, where the final version of the software was delivered and deployed for user use.
    \item \textbf{Phase 6}: Maintenance, where feedback was collected, and any necessary updates or bug fixes were applied.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Architecture}

\subsection{Dataset}
The project utilized datasets from Kaggle, which included anonymized student financial data. Preprocessing steps included cleaning missing values, normalizing income and expenditure data, and categorizing spending patterns into major groups like rent, food, and entertainment. 
\par Meanwhile, a database with random user information such as username, password, spending records, etc. was generated and implemented to test the website's usability.

\subsection{Methodology}
The system is structured around Python's Pandas library for data analysis, with Matplotlib for visualizing trends and insights. Key functions include user input validation, data comparison, and probability calculation using historical data. As the application is implemented as a website, flask framework is used, serving as a backend framework that facilitates the interaction between the front-end and back-end of the system.

\subsection{APIs used}
The software was built using various Python libraries, including: 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{PULP}: A Python linear programming API, mainly used for allocating the spending dynamically based on the user's saving goal.
    \item \textbf{statsmodels}: A statistical modeling and econometrics API in Python, implementation of which aims at predicting the future spending of the users based on their historical spending preference.
    \item \textbf{Matplotlib}: For data visualization.
\end{itemize}


\section{Software Testing}
Testing was performed at various stages: \begin{itemize} \item Unit tests for each function (e.g., input validation, spending analysis). \item Integration tests to ensure smooth interaction between modules. \item User acceptance testing to validate usability and performance. \end{itemize}
